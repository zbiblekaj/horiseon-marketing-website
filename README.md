# horiseon-website

I have created a webpage for a marketing agency, Horiseon, highlighting the aspects of search engine optimisation and its benefits. The webpage itself is written in code that follows accessbility standards and is optimised for search engines. 

The below screenshot displays the webpage. I have also attached a link onto this file in which you can access the webpage directly.
